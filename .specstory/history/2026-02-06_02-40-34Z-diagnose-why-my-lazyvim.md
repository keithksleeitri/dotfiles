   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      &#34;License&#34; shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,

      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      &#34;Source&#34; form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,

      &#34;Object&#34; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      &#34;Work&#34; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      &#34;Derivative Works&#34; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      &#34;Contribution&#34; shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &#34;submitted&#34;
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as &#34;Not a Contribution.&#34;

      &#34;Contributor&#34; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a &#34;NOTICE&#34; text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &#34;AS IS&#34; BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
- **Inspecting the Missing Key** — I'm now diving into the LazyVim configuration, specifically focusing on the dashboard setup. My initial thought is to check how the "p" keybinding for "open project" is handled there. I'll need to examine the `snacks.nvim` files, looking for the relevant keymap definitions. This should pinpoint where the binding is defined and help identify potential causes for its absence.
- **Unpacking the Dashboard Config** — I've located the `lazy.lua` configuration, confirming that LazyVim's plugin setup is being used and that the user's custom plugins are loaded from the `plugins` directory. Now, I'm going to carefully inspect the contents of that `plugins` directory, beginning with the `example.lua` file. Although it's disabled, I'll still give it a quick once-over to ensure there aren't any unexpected side effects.
- **Examining Keybindings' Origins** — I'm now investigating potential conflicts within the keybindings. I've confirmed `snacks.nvim` is indeed in use, so now the next step is to look at `snacks.nvim`'s keymap configuration. I'll need to locate where the "p" binding is set up and see if there are any overrides from the user's config that may be preventing it from functioning as expected, or if a competing binding is taking precedence.
- **Re-examining Plugin Structure** — I'm now back to scrutinizing the plugins directory, focusing on how LazyVim and custom plugins interact. It seems like the core configuration is in `lazy.lua`, which loads plugins from `lazyvim.plugins` and the `plugins` directory. The presence of `example.lua` and its disabling conditional is noted. I must check the default LazyVim extras and the `snacks.nvim` defaults to assess project key handling.
- **Unveiling Project Integration** — I'm now zeroing in on the project-opening functionality within Snacks. Since there's no custom `snacks.nvim` configuration, the defaults apply. My current theory is the `snacks.picker.projects()` call is failing, perhaps because `zoxide` isn't available or properly integrated. I'm checking for indicators of project detection limitations.
- **Investigating the 'p' Keybinding** — I'm now examining the integration of `zoxide` with the "open project" functionality. If `snacks.nvim` relies on `zoxide` for project discovery, a missing or misconfigured `zoxide` could explain why the "p" key is absent from the dashboard. I'll search for how `snacks.nvim` utilizes `zoxide` in its project picking logic.
- **Grasping the 'P' Issue** — I'm now focusing on potential causes for the missing "p" key. Based on LazyVim's default setup, the "p" key, when present, usually calls `snacks.picker.projects()`. The issue might stem from missing `zoxide` integration, an absence of project configurations, or perhaps a conflict in the dashboard's `snacks.nvim` options, which is the key area to inspect.
- **Verifying the Zoxide Dependency** — I'm now investigating potential dependencies that "p" keybinding might require. I'll focus on how `snacks.nvim` calls `zoxide` or project pickers, and confirm if `zoxide` is actually available to the Neovim environment. The configuration for project discovery via `snacks.picker.projects()` is key.
- **Gauging Dashboard Customization** — I'm now searching for any custom dashboard configurations within the user's setup. My investigation will center around potential customizations in the user's `lua/plugins` directory and the `lua/config` directory, specifically looking for files related to `snacks`, `alpha`, or any UI customization that could affect the dashboard's keybindings or display.

I will search for any configuration files in `dot_config/nvim` that reference "dashboard", "starter", or "snacks" to identify if there are any overrides affecting the LazyVim dashboard. I will also list all files in `dot_config/nvim/lua/plugins` to ensure I have a complete view of the plugins.

- **Pinpointing the Source** — I've zeroed in on the `example.lua` file, and confirmed it's disabled. The file list is also unhelpful, not finding any other plugin files. This strongly suggests the user is running the default LazyVim dashboard, which is Snacks.
- **Identifying the Cause** — I'm now focusing on `zoxide`. The lack of `zoxide` history could definitely be a cause, as `Snacks.picker.projects` defaults to it. Looking at `lazyvim.json` again, I see `lazyvim.plugins.extras.util.project` *is* indeed a potential factor. I need to check the user's configuration for that extra.
- **Testing the Configuration** — I've circled back to the user's LazyVim setup, and it seems likely the `util.project` extra is the key. The absence of the "Projects" section on the dashboard points to a missing configuration. I will now examine how the extra's absence would affect the dashboard's display.
- **Tracing the Missing Extra** — I'm now investigating the user's configuration history. My current focus is to determine *if* the `lazyvim.plugins.extras.util.project` extra was ever present. This could confirm the user intentionally removed it, or simply never had it enabled. Checking the `git diff` and `git log` of the `lazyvim.json` file should provide the answer.

I will check the git history of `dot_config/nvim/lazyvim.json` to see if `lazyvim.plugins.extras.util.project` was recently removed, which would explain why the "p" key for projects is missing from the dashboard.

_**Agent (gemini-3-pro-preview 2026-02-06 05:43:36Z)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
- **Examining the Config** — I'm currently focused on the recently created `dot_config/nvim/lazyvim.json` file. It's quite interesting because it lacks the expected `util.project` configuration. My initial hypothesis is that a previous configuration or default settings might have been in play. This merits further investigation.
- **Pinpointing the Root Cause** — I've been meticulously examining the LazyVim dashboard configuration, particularly `lua/lazyvim/plugins/ui.lua`, to understand why the "p" (Projects) option might be absent. The default configuration includes it, using `Snacks.picker.projects()`. The puzzle thickens as I consider potential conflicts or outdated settings related to the `snacks.nvim` plugin and its project discovery methods.
- **Debugging the Dashboard** — I'm now investigating whether the "p" (Projects) option is present in the dashboard configuration within `lua/lazyvim/plugins/ui.lua`. It should be, unless overridden. I'm also exploring the possibility of an invalid action like `Snacks.picker.projects()` or a dependency issue, such as `zoxide` not being properly configured, leading to the menu item being hidden or malfunctioning. My focus is now on verifying these potential failure points.
- **Adding the Project Extra** — I'm now proposing a solution: adding `lazyvim.plugins.extras.util.project` to `lazyvim.json`. This should enable project management functionality. I'm considering the interplay between `fzf-lua`, `telescope`, and the dashboard's "Projects" action (`Snacks.picker.projects()`) to confirm the setup. My goal is to streamline the project-related configurations.
- **Proposing a Solution** — My current thinking is to recommend enabling the `lazyvim.plugins.extras.util.project` extra within `lazyvim.json`. This directly addresses the need for project management features. Additionally, I'll advise checking `zoxide` configuration. The goal is to ensure project functionality within the LazyVim environment, given that the dashboard menu uses `Snacks.picker.projects()`. Further verification of the configuration will be required after applying the changes.
- **Validating the Zoxide** — I'm now switching gears to check for `zoxide` on the user's system, because Snacks relies on it for project detection. Using `run_shell_command("zoxide --version")`, I can determine if it's available and properly configured, and also because project discovery by Snacks depends on `zoxide` or git roots. This needs to be available before enabling the project extra.

I will check if `zoxide` is installed and reachable, as `Snacks.picker.projects` relies on it. Then, I will confirm if the `lazyvim.plugins.extras.util.project` extra is enabled in `dot_config/nvim/lazyvim.json`. If it's missing, I'll explain that this is likely the cause and propose adding it to restore the "Projects" functionality.

- **Examining Project Integration** — I've confirmed that `zoxide` is indeed installed. Now, I'm leaning toward the problem stemming from `lazyvim.plugins.extras.util.project` not being active. Alternatively, the dashboard might only display projects that have been previously accessed via `zoxide`, which is another angle to investigate.
- **Investigating Plugin Activation** — I'm now focusing on confirming whether `lazyvim.plugins.extras.util.project` is active. I recall it was missing in the `lazyvim.json` file. The question is, is adding it the correct LazyVim approach? I'm also considering potential conflicts if `project.nvim` is installed alongside `snacks`. My understanding of the most recent updates to LazyVim is that `snacks` is now preferred.
- **Clarifying Chezmoi Application** — I've determined that the user is working within `.local/share/chezmoi` and that changes here necessitate a `chezmoi apply` to take effect in the actual configuration directory. I'll explain this to the user to ensure the changes are correctly implemented. Also, I'm leaning towards the user having omitted the project extra during initial setup.
- **Analyzing Chezmoi Context** — I'm now certain the user's focus is in `.local/share/chezmoi`, thus, any edits to configuration files here necessitates a `chezmoi apply`. This is a crucial point I'll highlight for the user. I've also come to the conclusion that the user likely excluded the project extra during initial setup. I'm going to initiate the recommended change by modifying the `lazyvim.json` file.

I will read `dot_config/nvim/lazyvim.json` to confirm its current content. Then, I will add `lazyvim.plugins.extras.util.project` to the extras list in that file to enable project management features. Finally, I will instruct you to run `chezmoi apply` to apply these changes to your home directory.

- **Adding Missing Feature** — I've reviewed the `lazyvim.json` file and confirmed that `util.project` is indeed missing. I'm now in the process of adding this to the configuration. Afterward, I plan to explain to the user why this specific feature is crucial for project management functionality.
- **Incorporating the Change** — I'm now implementing the change by adding `"lazyvim.plugins.extras.util.project"` to `lazyvim.json`. I'll ensure the JSON remains valid, inserting the entry after the existing last item. Subsequently, I'll attempt to run `chezmoi apply` from within the directory to apply the configuration. I'm leaning toward just running `chezmoi apply`, since this is a "fix" and part of a software engineering workflow, and it will overwrite their configuration. I will double check to make sure `chezmoi apply` won't prompt and fail.
- **Completing the Insertion** — I'm inserting the `util.project` entry into `lazyvim.json`, placing it alphabetically after `util.dot` to maintain order and validity, and running `chezmoi apply` afterward to apply the change. The application is an action in the software engineering sense. I will then instruct the user to restart Neovim.

I will add `lazyvim.plugins.extras.util.project` to your `dot_config/nvim/lazyvim.json` file. This extra is required to enable the project management features (including the "p" key on the dashboard) that are currently missing. After updating the configuration, I will run `chezmoi apply` to deploy the changes to your local environment.
