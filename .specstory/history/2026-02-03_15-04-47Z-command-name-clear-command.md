Add this kind of operation to @justfile (so we can test run once script more easily)
```bash
# To test, you can run:
chezmoi state delete-bucket --bucket=scriptState  # Clear script state to re-run
chezmoi apply -v
```
Or if there exist better approaches please add them as well

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user wants me to add a command to the justfile that allows clearing the chezmoi script state so that run_once scripts can be re-tested. They've provided the specific commands they want to be able to run more easily.

Let me add a new recipe to the justfile under the Chezmoi section. I should add:
1. A command to clear script state and re-run
2. Possibly also a command to just clear the state without applying

Let me read the justfile again to make sure I have the latest version and understand the structure.

I'll add commands to the justfile for testing run_once scripts.

I've added two new commands:
1. `chezmoi-clear-scripts` - Just clears the script state bucket
2. `chezmoi-rerun-scripts` - Clears state and re-applies with verbose output

This gives the user flexibility to either just clear the state or clear and immediately re-run.

_**Agent (claude-opus-4-5-20251101 2026-02-03 15:06:29Z)**_

Added two new commands to the Chezmoi section:

- **`just chezmoi-clear-scripts`** - Clears only the script state (useful if you want to modify scripts before re-applying)
- **`just chezmoi-rerun-scripts`** - Clears state and immediately re-applies with verbose output

[SUGGESTION MODE: Suggest what the user might naturally type next into Claude Code.]

FIRST: Look at the user's recent messages and original request.

Your job is to predict what THEY would type - not what you think they should do.

THE TEST: Would they think "I was just about to type that"?

EXAMPLES:
User asked "fix the bug and run tests", bug is fixed → "run the tests"
After code written → "try it out"
Claude offers options → suggest the one the user would likely pick, based on conversation
Claude asks to continue → "yes" or "go ahead"
Task complete, obvious follow-up → "commit this" or "push it"
After error or misunderstanding → silence (let them assess/correct)

Be specific: "run the tests" beats "continue".

NEVER SUGGEST:
- Evaluative ("looks good", "thanks")
- Questions ("what about...?")
- Claude-voice ("Let me...", "I'll...", "Here's...")
- New ideas they didn't ask about
- Multiple sentences

Stay silent if the next step isn't obvious from what the user said.

Format: 2-12 words, match the user's style. Or nothing.

Reply with ONLY the suggestion, no quotes or explanation.

The user asked to add some chezmoi commands to the justfile, which I just did. The task appears complete - I added two new commands as requested.

Looking at the context:
1. The git status shows the Dockerfile is modified
2. The user was working on run_once script testing
3. They may want to commit this change

Since the task is complete and there's a modified justfile now, the natural next step would likely be to either:
- Test the new commands
- Commit the changes

Given the user's style (direct, task-oriented), they might want to commit this or test it. But this seems like a small, complete change. "commit this" seems like a natural follow-up.

Actually, let me reconsider - the user might want to see what the file looks like now, or they might want to try the commands. But committing seems most likely after a successful edit.
