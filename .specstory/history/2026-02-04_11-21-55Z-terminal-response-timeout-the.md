```
Terminal response timeout: The request sent by Yazi didn't receive a correct response.
Please check your terminal environment as per: https://yazi-rs.github.io/docs/faq#trt
```

Is there any issue with Yazi?

The user is asking about a Yazi terminal response timeout error. Let me search for information about this issue.

Yazi is a terminal file manager, and this error suggests there's a problem with the terminal's ability to respond to certain escape sequences that Yazi uses.

Let me check the Yazi FAQ page to understand what this error means and how to fix it.

# Terminal Response Timeout Errors

## Root Cause

According to the FAQ, "The error happens when running Yazi within tmux - tmux interferes with the communication between Yazi and the actual terminal in various ways."

## How to Fix

The documentation recommends checking five specific things:

1. **Update tmux** - Ensure you're running the latest version
2. **Enable passthrough** - Activate tmux passthrough for proper communication
3. **Check key bindings** - Avoid binding Alt+Shift+p to tmux, as "tmux currently doesn't support DECRQSS" and this causes key event conflicts
4. **Update st terminal** - If using st, verify it includes the Device Status Report fix
5. **Simplify configuration** - Comment out custom settings except passthrough to identify which configuration causes the issue, then restore them gradually

The underlying problem is that tmux's incomplete terminal protocol support creates conflicts between Yazi's communication attempts and tmux's own event handling, particularly around advanced terminal query sequences.

The FAQ explains that this is a common issue when running Yazi inside tmux. The terminal response timeout happens because tmux interferes with communication between Yazi and the actual terminal.

Let me provide a clear summary of the issue and solutions.

_**Agent (claude-opus-4-5-20251101 2026-02-04 11:22:15Z)**_

This is a known issue when running Yazi inside **tmux**. Tmux interferes with the communication between Yazi and your actual terminal.

## Fixes

1. **Update tmux** to the latest version

2. **Enable tmux passthrough** - Add this to your `~/.tmux.conf`:
   ```
   set -g allow-passthrough on
   ```
   Then reload tmux config: `tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf`

3. **Avoid binding Alt+Shift+p in tmux** - tmux doesn't support DECRQSS which causes conflicts

4. **If using st terminal** - ensure it has the Device Status Report fix

5. **Debug by simplifying config** - Comment out custom tmux settings (except passthrough) to identify the culprit

If you're not using tmux and still seeing this error, the issue may be with your terminal emulator not supporting certain escape sequences that Yazi uses for terminal detection.
